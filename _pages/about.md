My name is Altay and I am a PhD student in Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). I am currently also a graduate research assistant at NJIT. I completed my Master's in Computer Engineering at Istanbul Technical University (ITU).

My research interests include but not limited to continual learning, machine unlearning and machine learning on graphs.
